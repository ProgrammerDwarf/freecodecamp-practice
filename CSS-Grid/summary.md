# This is the CSS GRID chapter

Here, we will learn about the 2D design tool that is CSS-GRID:

## The idea of working in 2D

In addition to Flexbox, the Grid has the facility to work (simultaneously) horizontally and vertically. Flexbox has its way
To refer to its internal elements, Grids also has it. Here, we divide the page into rows and columns. The first works
horizontally and the last works vertically.

## A parents relationship

First, We need two key characters here: the parent and the child element.

## First property here

- `grid`: By setting the `display: grid` on the parent will not cause any changes (visually I mean) on the page but I'll tell to the browser
that it will be the container.

## What's next?

Well, now I will list the properties to use the grid:
- `grid-template-row`: This will set the amount of elements that will be in the row and can be divided with any type of unit in the same way that sets the width of an element.
Example: `grid-temple-row: 1fr 20px 50%`. Here there will be three elements in the row, each with a different width. We know the last two, but the first one referred to a
fraction of the free space that the container.
