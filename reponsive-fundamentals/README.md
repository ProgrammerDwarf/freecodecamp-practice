# Fundamentals of responsive web design

## First, look at the queries.

Media queries are a solution to adapt the content of the page according to the device you are using.
For example, you want to show some content in a certain way depending on the width or if the device is in "landscape" or "portrait" mode.

## Responsive image

You can achieve a responsive image doing the following set up:
1- Assign a max-width property of 100%, like that, you can cover the container but ensure that the image doesn't expand.
2- Then, display the img tag as a block element.
3- Last, put the height in auto, this will ensure the aspect ratio of the image.
