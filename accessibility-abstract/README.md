# Elements in the semantic model

## The header tag

Given that some people need to use screen readers and some other tools to get the information on our page. The header has an important task. First, it serves as the introduction of what will be a menu or information that people generally use to find pages on our site.
Second, it serves like an element that will be part of a template for the static sites generators.

## The main tag

The main tag serves to surround the important and main information (yes, you guessed it). It is recommended to only have one tag per page.

## The article tag

This tag is used for content that has its own meaning, does not depend on the context and if you take it from the page it does not lose the meaning

## The section tag

Similar to article but this serves like an element from a collection, doing groups with a commom theme or subject.
The example used for learning was this: "If an article is a book, the sections are the chapters.

## The footer tag

It's like the header, but it contains the content that will guide you to related content or information about site owners, restrictions, licensing and things that users generally don't want to see at first sight of the site.

## The audio tag

As the title says, it serves as a component to listen to an audio track. If you set the `controls` attribute, you will place buttons to control the audio, such as playback, pause and progress bar.

## The figure and caption

This duo is excellent to put an image and a brief explaniation to the screen readers of the image. The `figcaption` goes inside the `figure` tag.
