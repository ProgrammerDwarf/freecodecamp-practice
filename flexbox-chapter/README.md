# A flexible tool

Flexbox is a tool that allows us to make flexible layouts. Thus, We can adapt each part of out page to differents viewports.
Also, We have to notice and remember that this is a one-dimension layout method.

## A relationship of two key elements

First, We need a parent element and second, its children elements.  

- Parent: Element that has one or more children in it.
- Children: Elements that are inside of a container.

### Properties for the parent

- `display: flex`: this is the attribute that we have to assign to a parent element. The entire interior of this container will become a flexible element.
Another thing about this property is that when used, the child elements will expand to fill the entire container evenly.
- `flex-direction`: it has two main options: row and column, but there are other possibilities.
- `row`
- `column`
- `reverse row`
- `column-reverse`
The last two will not change the order of the elements on the HTML side. In fact, this will change the way the elements appear only visually.
